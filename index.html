          <p> Wetlands are essential for maintaining ecological balance by supporting biodiversity, regulating water cycles, and improving water quality. In the U.S., many are managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which oversees over 245 million acres of public lands (Fig. 1). The BLM’s wetland and riparian monitoring programs, such as the National AIM Riparian and Wetland Indicators Hub, play a key role in sustaining ecosystem health. However, wetland condition and distribution vary greatly by geography, climate, and land use. Some states maintain diverse systems, while others face degradation from aridity or human pressures, posing challenges for equitable conservation planning.

            This study analyzes BLM-managed wetlands across the western U.S. to identify areas needing greater conservation focus. Large regional disparities exist: Nevada holds the most wetlands, followed by California and Alaska, while Oregon has the fewest. These differences reflect climatic and geographic influences and highlight the need for region-specific conservation strategies to strengthen ecosystem resilience.

<h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Methodology</h2>
      <p>
Data from the BLM Natl AIM Riparian and Wetland Indicators Hub (Bureau of Land Management, 2025) was analyzed to assess the ecological diversity and health of wetlands across the contiguous U.S. All processing and visualization, including bar charts, heatmaps, and interactive mapping, were conducted in Python.
              <br><br>
        Shannon entropy (H = −Σ pᵢ ln pᵢ) and its exponential, the Hill number (eᴴ), were used to measure true diversity among wetland types. The average C value served as a biological indicator of wetland integrity, where higher values represent less-disturbed ecosystems.
              <br><br>
        By combining these metrics with visualization, this study highlights regional disparities and supports data-driven conservation planning.      </p>

            Figure 3 shows that Slope and Riverine wetlands dominate many western regions, indicating terrain-driven hydrology and strong surface flow influence. In contrast, Depression and Flat types are more common in lowland or coastal areas, reflecting greater water retention and limited drainage.

    <p>
      Figure 5 illustrates how vegetation composition varies across BLM-managed states. Oregon and Utah show notably higher proportions of non-native vegetation, suggesting stronger ecological disturbance and reduced habitat stability. In contrast, states such as Alaska and Wyoming are dominated by native vegetation, indicating more intact wetland ecosystems with lower levels of biological disruption.

    </figure>

    <p>
      Figure 6 shows a strong positive relationship between Hill’s N1 (species diversity) and the average C value (ecological integrity). Wetlands with higher species diversity tend to exhibit healthier ecological conditions, while degraded, low-diversity systems cluster in states such as Nevada, Idaho, and Utah, where arid environments and land-use pressures are more intense.
      <br><br>
      Together, Figure 5 and 6 demonstrate that declines in biodiversity and increases in non-native vegetation frequently occur in the same regions. These patterns highlight the importance of targeted restoration efforts and adaptive vegetation management to maintain ecological resilience across western U.S. wetlands.

<h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Conclusion</h2>

    <div class="content has-text-justified">
      <p>
The analysis demonstrates clear ecological heterogeneity among wetlands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), revealing both regional strengths and areas of concern. Across 875 evaluated sites, 254 were classified as degraded (Hill’s N1 ≤ 8.0, C Value ≤ 3.0), primarily concentrated in Nevada, Idaho, and Utah, where arid climates and land-use intensity constrain ecological recovery and reduce native vegetation.

In contrast, Alaska and parts of the central U.S. show higher Mean C Values and more balanced wetland compositions, indicating stronger ecological stability and lower human disturbance. The HGM analysis revealed dominance of Slope and Riverine wetlands, underscoring the importance of hydrologic connectivity while also highlighting vulnerability to drought and flow alteration in western regions.

Vegetation composition further showed elevated proportions of non-native species in Vernal Pools and Riparian Forests or Woodlands, signaling long-term disturbance from agriculture and grazing. Spatially, interactive mapping and heatmap results identified clusters of low-diversity, low-integrity wetlands in southern Nevada and central Idaho, contrasting with resilient systems in Alaska and Wyoming.

Overall, these results call for targeted conservation, adaptive restoration, and sustained monitoring, particularly in Nevada, Idaho, and Utah. Meanwhile, Alaska’s wetlands, though relatively stable, remain under-monitored, requiring continued assessment to ensure resilience under changing climate conditions.

<h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Future Research</h2>
    <div class="content has-text-justified">
      <p>
This study provides a spatially explicit understanding of wetland integrity across BLM-managed lands, but several limitations suggest clear directions for future research. The analysis relied primarily on AIM monitoring data, which may not capture temporal or seasonal variation in biodiversity and hydrology. Future studies should integrate multi-year datasets and remote sensing indicators such as NDVI, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration to identify longer-term ecological trends.

The current framework emphasized biological integrity (C Value) and species diversity (Hill’s N1), but did not fully account for abiotic stressors such as water chemistry, nutrient loading, and land-use intensity. Incorporating these variables would strengthen predictive modeling and improve early detection of ecological degradation. Additionally, applying spatial regression or machine learning approaches may help uncover causal drivers of wetland decline and reveal thresholds of ecological resilience.

Advancing this research will also require interdisciplinary collaboration. Partnerships with hydrologists, climate scientists, and local conservation agencies can enhance modeling accuracy and policy relevance, while engagement with tribal land managers and citizen scientists could expand monitoring coverage and improve dataset richness.

Finally, this framework could be extended to other ecosystems—such as grasslands, riparian corridors, and arid landscapes—to support broader climate-resilient land management initiatives and inform national-scale conservation planning.
