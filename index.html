This project provides a spatially explicit assessment of wetland integrity across Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in the United States, using ecological monitoring data from the BLM National AIM Riparian and Wetland Indicators Hub. Through Python-based processing, visualization, and interactive mapping, we analyzed biodiversity using Shannon entropy and Hill’s N1, and ecological condition using the Mean C value. Results reveal substantial regional disparities: Nevada, Idaho, and Utah contain the highest concentration of degraded wetlands (Hill’s N1 ≤ 8.0, C Value ≤ 3.0), largely driven by arid climates and land-use pressures. In contrast, Alaska and parts of the central U.S. show higher diversity and stronger ecological stability. Hydrogeomorphic (HGM) analyses highlight the dominance of Slope and Riverine wetlands across the West, while vegetation metrics show elevated non-native plant presence in disturbed regions. Collectively, these findings emphasize the need for region-specific conservation strategies, targeted restoration, and improved long-term monitoring. The study demonstrates how integrated ecological indicators and geospatial visualization can support data-driven decision-making for wetland conservation across federally managed landscapes.

    <div class="content has-text-justified">
      <p>
    Wetlands play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by supporting biodiversity, regulating hydrological cycles, and improving water quality. In the United States, many of these critical ecosystems are managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which oversees over 245 million acres of public lands across diverse landscapes (Figure 1). The BLM’s wetland and riparian monitoring programs, including the National AIM Riparian and Wetland Indicators Hub, are central to sustaining ecosystem health and ensuring that these lands continue to provide essential ecological services.
      <br><br>
    However, the condition and distribution of wetlands vary widely depending on geography, climate, and land-use pressures. While some states maintain abundant and diverse wetland systems, others face degradation due to aridity, water scarcity, or anthropogenic stress. These disparities present a growing challenge for federal land managers seeking to allocate conservation resources equitably across regions.

      <p>
This study aims to analyze BLM-managed wetlands across the western United States to identify areas that may require increased conservation attention and funding. Figure 2 presents the total number of wetlands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) across eight western states. The results reveal strong spatial disparities in wetland abundance: Nevada contains the highest number of wetlands (198), followed by California (160) and Alaska (115), while Oregon has the fewest (6). These patterns illustrate how geographic and climatic conditions influence wetland distribution, Nevada’s dominance, for instance, reflects its extensive Playa wetlands formed in arid basins, whereas Oregon’s low count suggests more limited BLM-managed wetland coverage. Taken together, these findings highlight the uneven distribution of wetland resources under federal management and suggest that conservation strategies should be region-specific, prioritizing both ecological diversity and environmental stress factors to enhance the resilience of U.S. wetland ecosystems

<!-- Methodology -->
<section class="section" id="methodology">
  <div class="container is-max-desktop">
    <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      Data from the BLM National AIM Riparian and Wetland Indicators Hub (Bureau of Land Management, 2025) was analyzed to assess the ecological diversity and health of wetlands across the contiguous United States. All processing and visualization—including bar charts, heatmaps, and interactive mapping—were conducted in Python.
      <br><br>
      Shannon entropy (H = −Σ pᵢ ln pᵢ) and its exponential, the Hill number (eᴴ), were used to measure true diversity among wetland types. The average C value served as a biological indicator of wetland integrity, where higher values represent less-disturbed ecosystems.
      <br><br>
      By combining these metrics with data visualization, this study identifies regional disparities in wetland conditions and supports data-driven conservation planning across BLM-managed landscapes.

    Figure 5 illustrates how vegetation composition varies across BLM-managed states.

      Figure 6 shows a strong positive relationship between Hill’s N1 (species diversity) and the average C value (ecological integrity). Wetlands with higher species diversity tend to exhibit healthier ecological conditions, while degraded, low-diversity systems cluster in states such as Nevada, Idaho, and Utah, where arid environments and land-use pressures are more intense.
      <br><br>
      Together, Figure 5 and 6 demonstrate that declines in biodiversity and increases in non-native vegetation frequently occur in the same regions. These patterns highlight the importance of targeted restoration efforts and adaptive vegetation management to maintain ecological resilience across western U.S. wetlands.

<section class="section" id="conclusion">
  <div class="container is-max-desktop">
    <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Conclusion</h2>
    <div class="content has-text-justified">
      <p>
        The analysis demonstrates clear ecological heterogeneity among wetlands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), revealing both regional strengths and areas of concern. Across 875 evaluated sites, 254 were classified as degraded (Hill’s N1 ≤ 8.0, C Value ≤ 3.0), primarily concentrated in Nevada, Idaho, and Utah, where arid climates and land-use intensity constrain ecological recovery and reduce native vegetation.
        <br><br>
        In contrast, Alaska and parts of the central U.S. show higher Mean C Values and more balanced wetland compositions, indicating stronger ecological stability and lower human disturbance. The HGM analysis revealed dominance of Slope and Riverine wetlands, underscoring the importance of hydrologic connectivity while also highlighting vulnerability to drought and flow alteration in western regions.
        <br><br>
        Vegetation composition further showed elevated proportions of non-native species in Vernal Pools and Riparian Forests or Woodlands, signaling long-term disturbance from agriculture and grazing. Spatially, interactive mapping and heatmap results identified clusters of low-diversity, low-integrity wetlands in southern Nevada and central Idaho, contrasting with resilient systems in Alaska and Wyoming.
        <br><br>
        Overall, these results call for targeted conservation, adaptive restoration, and sustained monitoring, particularly in Nevada, Idaho, and Utah. Meanwhile, Alaska’s wetlands, though relatively stable, remain under-monitored, requiring continued assessment to ensure resilience under changing climate conditions.

<!-- Future Research -->
<section class="section" id="future">
  <div class="container is-max-desktop">
    <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Future Research</h2>
    <div class="content has-text-justified">
      <p>
        This study provides a spatially explicit understanding of wetland integrity across BLM-managed lands, but several limitations suggest clear directions for future research. The analysis relied primarily on AIM monitoring data, which may not capture temporal or seasonal variation in biodiversity and hydrology. Future studies should integrate multi-year datasets and remote sensing indicators such as NDVI, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration to identify longer-term ecological trends.
        <br><br>
        The current framework emphasized biological integrity (C Value) and species diversity (Hill’s N1), but did not fully account for abiotic stressors such as water chemistry, nutrient loading, and land-use intensity. Incorporating these variables would strengthen predictive modeling and improve early detection of ecological degradation. Additionally, applying spatial regression or machine learning approaches may help uncover causal drivers of wetland decline and reveal thresholds of ecological resilience.
        <br><br> 
        Advancing this research will also require interdisciplinary collaboration. Partnerships with hydrologists, climate scientists, and local conservation agencies can enhance modeling accuracy and policy relevance, while engagement with tribal land managers and citizen scientists could expand monitoring coverage and improve dataset richness.
        <br><br>
Finally, this framework could be extended to other ecosystems—such as grasslands, riparian corridors, and arid landscapes—to support broader climate-resilient land management initiatives and inform national-scale conservation planning.
